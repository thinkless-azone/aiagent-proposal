  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / High-Tech Industrial
  **Core Principles**: Raw functionality, bold typography, high contrast, modular grids.
  **Color Philosophy**: Stark black and white with electric blue (#0047FF) accents. Represents precision, clarity, and the "no-nonsense" nature of financial automation.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric grid layouts, visible borders, sticky side navigation, large typography for headings.
  **Signature Elements**: Monospace fonts for data, thick borders, marquee text for announcements, technical diagrams as background elements.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Snappy, instant transitions. Hover effects that invert colors or reveal technical details.
  **Animation**: Glitch effects on load, smooth scrolling with parallax for data sections.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Space Grotesk' or 'JetBrains Mono' (Bold, Uppercase)
    - Body: 'Inter' or 'Roboto Mono' (Clean, legible)

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Modernized)
  **Core Principles**: Cleanliness, readability, objectivity, strong grid systems.
  **Color Philosophy**: White background with dark grey text and a single strong accent color (e.g., Swiss Red or Deep Teal). Focus on content and data hierarchy.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Strict grid, ample whitespace, left-aligned text, asymmetric balance.
  **Signature Elements**: Large, bold headings, minimal icons, high-quality photography or data visualization as focal points.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Subtle, refined interactions. Focus on micro-interactions (button clicks, link hovers).
  **Animation**: Precise, linear transitions. Elements snap into place.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Helvetica Now' or 'Arial' (Classic, neutral) - *Using 'Inter' as web alternative*
    - Body: 'Inter' (Clean, neutral)

## Selected Approach: Neo-Brutalism / High-Tech Industrial

**Reasoning**: This style aligns perfectly with the "AI Agent for Industrial/Financial Automation" theme. It conveys reliability, precision, and a modern technological edge without being overly decorative. The high contrast and modular layout are excellent for presenting technical specifications and financial data.

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Aesthetic**: "Data is Beautiful". We will treat the proposal content as a technical dashboard.
- **Colors**:
  - Background: `#0F172A` (Slate 900) - Deep, professional dark mode base.
  - Surface: `#1E293B` (Slate 800) - Slightly lighter for cards/modules.
  - Accent: `#3B82F6` (Blue 500) - Trust and technology.
  - Text: `#F8FAFC` (Slate 50) - High readability.
  - Borders: `#334155` (Slate 700) - Visible, structural borders.
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: `Space Grotesk` - Technical, modern, slightly quirky.
  - Body: `Inter` - Standard for readability.
  - Monospace: `JetBrains Mono` - For code snippets, data values, and technical specs.
- **Layout**:
  - Sidebar navigation for easy access to proposal sections.
  - Card-based content areas with visible borders.
  - Data visualization (charts) integrated directly into the flow.
